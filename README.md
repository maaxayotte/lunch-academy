An app that allows a user to post recipes they have created with pictures, and allows other users to rate and review them. Worked as a team of four using Git and the Agile Methodology to plan out tasks daily and split off into pair programming groups. Used React and Express within a NodeJS environment to dynamically display content, user reviews, and a 5 star rating system. Used Express, Knex, Objection and Postgres to create a database and pass data from the front end to the back end and persist and Passport for user creation and authentication.

- Reactjs frontend framework
- Express backend routers
- SQL database that is set up with Objection
